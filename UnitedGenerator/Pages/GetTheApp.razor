<h4>This website is something called a PWA (Progressive Web App), this means that yo can install it on your device!</h4>

<p>You have the option of installing the app into your OS's start menu, dock, or home screen. 
The way this option is presented depends on your browser. </p>

<p>When using desktop Chromium-based browsers, such as Edge or Chrome, an Add button appears within the URL bar. 
After you click the Add button, you will receive a confirmation dialog:</p>

<br />

<p>On iOS, you can install the PWA using Safari's Share button and its Add to Homescreen option.</p> 

<p>On Chrome for Android, you should select the Menu button in the upper-right corner, followed by Add to Home screen.</p>

<p>Once installed, the app appears in its own window without the browser and can even be used offline!</p>
