<h4 class="mt-5">How hard can it be?</h4>
<p>
    The generator is quite complicated and takes a lot of things into account, if you want to look (or even review) what data goes into the generator 
    <a href="data">please take a look</a>.
</p>
<p>
    For now here are the highligts (if you want to know):
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Select the of number required Heroes
        <ul>
            <li>Select backup heroes for Villains that needs more than the starting Heroes (Like Thanos and Deadpool).</li>
            <li>Exclude Heroes not allowed by the Villains (like normal Colosus and Phoenix Five Colosus).</li>
            <li>Sometimes it can select a Hero Team and select Heroes from this groups first.<br />
                This way you have the chance to play as the Fantastic Four or Cloak and Dagger. While other Heroes will be added if needed.<br />
                Note that team members also can be included in normal random selection.<br />
                This feature is mostly created to support the upcumming team decks in season 3.</li>
            <li>If the Villain needs more than the starting Heroes, these will also be selected from a Team if relevant.</li>
            <li>You can include up to 8 heroes, it is not officially supported but some people do it anyway.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>    
    <li>When fighting a team of villains all team members will be listed. <br />
        This is really made to support the upcomming 'Sinister Six Assembled' module in Season 3.
    </li>
    <li>Generate multi-games Villains (like Thanos, Apocalypse and Phoenix Five), where a number of games must be generated individually.</li>

        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
